            <h4> Elongate on Ethereum: White Paper</h4>
<p>Introduction: <br>
Elongate is a community-driven cryptocurrency token that was launched on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) in March 2021. It aims to support various charitable causes, with a particular focus on wildlife conservation and animal welfare. The project has gained a lot of attention and support from the crypto community, particularly on social media platforms like Twitter and Reddit.
    In this white paper, we outline our plans to expand Elongate to the Ethereum blockchain and establish it as the main meme coin token of 2023.</p>

            <div class="col-md-6">
                <h3 id="tokenomics">Tokenomics: </h3>
<p>Elongate on Ethereum will offer the same tokenomics as on Binance Smart Chain. Every transaction involving ELONGATE will incur a 10% fee, which is split between a liquidity pool and redistributed to all ELONGATE holders. This mechanism helps to maintain liquidity for the token and incentivize holding.
    In addition, we plan to introduce a new mechanism to burn a percentage of the transaction fee, which will decrease the overall supply of ELONGATE over time. This will help to maintain the value of the token and provide a deflationary aspect to the project.</p>
